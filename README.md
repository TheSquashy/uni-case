# Cases for the Uni

Here you'll find case, plate, and midpiece files for the Uni. Look in the stl folder if you want files to 3d print. I will explain what each file is below.

This is still a work in progress, plate and backplate is still missing.

# Case

Case is the thing you attach below the main PCB using stand-offs. It is very short, sitting flush to the top of the main PCB. Use this if you are not using a plate, backplate, or midpiece.

# Midpiece

If you have a backplate and you just want to cover the space between the board and the backplate, the midpiece is perfect for you. If you have a v3, use the usbc version. If you have the v2, use the promicro version.

# Plate Case

It's an experimental work that is only compatible with the v3 if you are willing to desolder the switches and then resolder them.
